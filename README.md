# ReactJS Date Ranges

This is the same as my other [repo date ranges](https://github.com/TravisL12/date_ranges) but this time with ReactJS.

The environment was built following [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/setup-a-react-environment-using-webpack-and-babel)

Steps to build and run:

1. `brew install yarn` (optional if you have it installed)

2. `npm install`

3. `yarn start`

4. A window should open with the project, if not you can find it http://0.0.0.0:8080
